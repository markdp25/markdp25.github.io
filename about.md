I am currently a Bloc student in their Part-Time Web Development Program. Ever since I was a little kid growing up in Rhode Island, I have had a passion for computers and technology, and that passion still exists today which is why I am excited to start my new career in web development. Some other passions of mine include boating, sports, and reading.

My Journey:

Currently I am Boston-based where I have been since 2015 working as a Sales Manager for The Scotts Miracle Gro Company. Throughout my time there I have dealt with people management, inventory, marketing, and sales. I have met with regional executives for Home Depot and Lowes to give them presentations on products and programs we offer.

Prior to working at Scotts Miracle Gro, I was an Account Executive for Yelp Inc starting in September of 2013 in their New York City office. There I was responsible for advertising sales to small-medium local businesses in my assigned territory.

I attended a small liberal arts college in Manchester, New Hampshire called Saint Anselm's College where I majored in Business. I took classes in Marketing, Computer Science, Economics, and Finance. During my time at Saint Anselm's I also was a member of the Varsity Lacrosse Team, an NCAA Division 2 program.

Throughout my time in college, I would help my father out at work on my breaks. During those breaks, I created his company's Facebook page, launched their Facebook advertising program, and started to create other social media accounts for them, in hopes to get them a base for entering the digital world.
