title: The Journey Continues
---

I just got my first job as an Account Executive for Yelp in New York City, I was excited and I was eager to start. I had two weeks to find an apartment in New York City and move there before starting. It was stressful but I managed to get it done.

There I was bright eyed and bushy tailed in the Big Apple ready to conquer the world. I went for my first day it was great. I was part of a class of 30 people, most fresh out of college on their first job, and we all had the same ambitions. Once all of our training was done, we finally got to start our work. We were all put on to sales teams and then assigned territories somewhere in the U.S. and our jobs were to cold call the local businesses and talk to them about Yelp and advertising on Yelp.

The job was great at first but I slowly found myself getting tired of the cold calling and decided to start looking elsewhere after a year there.

Now in college I played lacrosse so I spent most of my summers training to get ready but my junior and senior year I also worked full time as a merchandiser for Scotts Miracle Gro. Originally they were interested in my to become a sales manager in Boston but the position was not open at the time of my graduation so it was not possible. But when I started to look at jobs while at Yelp, I looked back at Scotts and the position was open. After interviewing for the position in Boston, they told me I was the guy for the job. So in February of 2015, I moved to Boston and began my job as a Sales Manager.
